  The JMX Monitor Project provides a daemon (or commandline) tool to monitor a series of JMX services.

  The basic model is

  * JMX View spawns N

  ** Monitoring Groups which contain N

  *** Monitors that gather data

  *** Expressions that format data

  * These are outputted to rolling log files for external tools (e.g. Nagios or Cacti) to process.
